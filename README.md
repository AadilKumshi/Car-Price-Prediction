[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20App-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=streamlit)](https://car-price-prediction-aadil.streamlit.app/)

An interactive machine learning app that predicts the **selling price of a used car** based on key attributes such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

Built using **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** â€” this end-to-end project demonstrates real-world ML deployment and user-facing interface design.



##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of a real-world machine learning workflow:
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Linear Regression model training  
- One-hot encoding for categorical features  
- Real-time prediction through an interactive UI

The goal is to provide users with an intuitive way to estimate the price of a used car using only basic information.



##  Features

-  Clean, responsive UI built with Streamlit  
-  Dropdowns and sliders for live input of car specs  
-  Real-time price prediction  
-  Model trained on real-world automotive data  
-  Fully deployed and shareable app



## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Source: `carproject.csv` (used car dataset)
- Features used:
  - `Brand`
  - `Body`
  - `Engine Type`
  - `Registration`
  - `Year`
  - `Mileage`



##  ML Model

- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `streamlit`



##  Future Enhancements

- Add support for other models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Display model evaluation metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE)
- Visualize feature importance using SHAP
- Allow CSV upload for batch predictions
